## About this project

This is an Open-source version of the standard /UI2/CL_JSON class, and its public documentation was previously available on the SCN wiki as "One more ABAP to JSON Serializer and Deserializer" in 2013.
The official delivery of /UI2/CL_JSON will continue. The Open Source version (Z_UI2_JSON) is your way to contribute and get updates sooner using ABAP Git infrastructure. 

### Why
There are a lot of other implementations of the **ABAP to JSON Serializer and Deserializer** in SDN. Still, I found all implementations unsuitable for my needs for different reasons. From SAP_BASIS 7.40, there is also **a simple transformation** available for converting **ABAP to JSON** and **JSON to ABAP**. It is the best choice if you need maximal performance and do not care about **serialization format**, but it fits badly for properly handling ABAP types and name **pretty-printing**. 

So, I have written my **ABAP JSON serializer** and **ABAP JSON deserializer**, which have some key differences from other implementations.

Here, you can find an Open-Source version of the standard /UI2/CL_JSON class in the form of a Z* class that you can use as a local or global one.

An original and current source version can be found in class /UI2/CL_JSON delivered with UI2 Add-on (can be applied to SAP_BASIS 740 â€“ 76X). So, you can use this ABAP JSON parser in your standard code, mostly on any system.

The minimum required SAP_BASIS version for the class is SAP_BASIS 7.31 (ABAP language dependency, e.g., usage of "escape" function).

## Alternatives
