## About this project

This is Open source version of standard /UI2/CL_JSON class and its public documentation were previosly available on SCN wiki as "One more ABAP to JSON Serializer and Deserializer" from 2013. 

### Why
There are a lot of other implementations of the **ABAP to JSON Serializer and Deserializer** in SDN, but for different reasons, all implementations I have found were not suitable for my needs. From SAP_BASIS 7.40 there is also **a simple transformation** available for converting **ABAP to JSON** and **JSON to ABAP**. It is the best choice if you need maximal performance and do not care about **serialization format**, but for proper handling of ABAP types and name **pretty-printing**, it fits badly. 

So, I have written my **ABAP JSON serializer and ABAP JSON deserializer** which has some key differences from other implementations.

Below you can find a snippet of the ABAP JSON class I wrote, that you can use as a local class or as a global after renaming.

An original and actual version of the source can be found in class /UI2/CL_JSON delivered with UI2 Add-on (can be applied to SAP_BASIS 700 â€“ 76X). So, you can use this ABAP JSON parser in your standard code mostly on any system.
